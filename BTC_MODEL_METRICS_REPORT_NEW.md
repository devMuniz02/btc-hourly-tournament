## Metric Definitions

- Accuracy is wins divided by evaluated predictions.
- Accuracy Last 240 is the same calculation using only the latest 240 evaluated predictions for that variation and model; if fewer than 240 exist, it uses all available evaluated predictions.
- Accuracy Last 480 is the same calculation using only the latest 480 evaluated predictions for that variation and model; if fewer than 480 exist, it uses all available evaluated predictions.
- Accuracy Delta From 50% is the absolute percentage-point difference between overall accuracy and 50%.
- Net wins is wins minus losses.
- Net wins per day is net wins divided by unique UTC dates with evaluated predictions.
- Missing and failed rows are included in coverage metadata and excluded from model metric calculations.
- Old/new report scopes split rows by the pre-forward-backfill latest prediction timestamp for each variation.
